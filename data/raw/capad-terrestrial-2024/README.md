# Collaborative Australian Protected Areas Database: protected area data

## Overview

The Collaborative Australian Protected Areas Database (CAPAD) is a spatial and textual database that provides information on Australiaâ€™s protected areas at national, state and territory levels. Published every 2 years, CAPAD provides a national perspective of the conservation of biodiversity in protected areas.

CAPAD includes information on all protected areas, including IUCN category, location (latitude and longitude of midpoint (centroid), area (hectares) and gazettal date for declaring a protected area.

It also provides summary information on protected areas by:
* reservation type designations (e.g. National Park, Conservation Covenant, Indigenous Protected Area)
* IUCN management categories (i.e. category Ia to category VI)
* reservation type designations as a proportion of IBRA (Version 7.1) regions at the jurisdictional level (e.g. the number on of type designations within the Victorian Midlands (VM) IBRA region in Victoria and the percentage of those types of protected areas within that region)
* IUCN management categories as a proportion of IBRA region (e.g. the number of Category II protected areas in Queensland and the percentage of those IUCN categories within each Queensland IBRA region)
* the level of protection of IBRA regions and IBRA subregions
* governance at the national level (e.g. Government, Joint, Indigenous and Private).
