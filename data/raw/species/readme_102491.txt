[Data Summary] Spatial information about the location and suitability of areas
for native plant and animal species under different climate futures is an
important input to land use and conservation planning and management. Australia,
renowned for its abundant species diversity and endemism, often relies on
modelled data to assess species distributions due to the country's vast size and
the challenges associated with conducting on-ground surveys on such a large
scale. Modelled habitat suitability maps use information about known occurrences
of species and predict suitable areas for species using climate, soil and
landscape information. Using MaxEnt, we produced Australia-wide habitat
suitability maps under RCP2.6-SSP1, RCP4.5-SSP2, RCP7.0-SSP3 and RCP8.5-SSP5
climate futures for 1,382 terrestrial vertebrates and 9,251 vascular plants at
5km2 for open access. This represents 60% of all Australian mammal species, 77%
of amphibian species, 50% of reptile species, 71% of bird species and 44% of
vascular plant species. We also include tabular data which includes summaries of
total quality-weighted habitat area of species under different climate scenarios
and time periods. These habitat suitability maps can be used as input data for
landscape and conservation planning or species management, particularly under
different climate change scenarios in Australia.
